# Wright State University CS/CE Alumni Society Hackathon FAQ

## Requirements

Your team must provide:

- **Git Repository**: Public repository (at least during the Hackathon) with commits ONLY from your team members
- **Presentation**: Formal presentation for judges
- **Docker Container**: Required for Web/Mobile applications so mentors and judges can easily run your app
- **Video**: NOT REQUIRED (dropped from last year)

## Theme: Real World MVP

The theme is "Real World MVP" (Minimal Viable Product). The goal of the 24-hour hackathon is to demonstrate your base idea in a functional state. Your project doesn't need to be finished or polished, but it must be demo-ready.

Think of this as a startup pitch: you have a product idea and the judges are your "investors." Show them why your MVP is worth their investment.

## Presentation Standards

**Hard Requirements:**

- Each team must present in front of judges
- **10-minute hard cap** per team:
  - **3 minutes**: PowerPoint presentation introducing your team and app idea
  - **7 minutes**: Technical demo (live demonstration of your product)

**Important Notes:**

- This is a product presentation, NOT a line-by-line code walkthrough
- Judges may ask about code structure and design considerations
- You must be able to demonstrate your working product

## AI Rules

There are no hard rules for or against AI use. AI is becoming an integral part of software engineering, and familiarity with appropriate AI usage is important in the real world. However, this hackathon is ultimately about demonstrating **your** skills, understanding, and decision-making abilities.

**Hard Requirement:**

- No AI bots should make commits to your repository

### Understanding the AI Knowledge Gap

Over-reliance on AI tools can create a dangerous knowledge gap between you and your codebase. When AI generates large portions of your project without your deep understanding of how it works, you risk:

- **Inability to Debug**: When something breaks (and it will), you won't know where to start fixing it
- **Architecture Blindness**: You won't understand why certain design patterns were chosen or what tradeoffs were made
- **Performance Issues**: You may not recognize inefficient algorithms or database queries that AI generated
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: You might miss critical security flaws in AI-generated code
- **Integration Problems**: You won't understand how different components interact, making it difficult to extend or modify features

### What Judges Might Ask

Judges are experienced developers who can quickly identify when a team doesn't understand their own code. Expect questions like:

- "Why did you choose this architecture over alternatives?"
- "What design patterns are you using and why?"
- "How does your data flow through the application?"
- "What would you do differently if you had more time?"
- "How did you handle [specific technical challenge]?"
- "Walk me through your database schema design decisions"
- "What performance considerations did you make?"
- "How would you scale this application?"

If your answers are vague, contradictory, or show a fundamental misunderstanding of your own codebase, judges will lose trust in your team's abilities. This won't disqualify you, but it **will significantly impact the accolades you receive and the networking opportunities available to you**.

### The Trust Factor

Judges aren't just evaluating your final product—they're evaluating **you** as developers. In the real world "MVP/Investor" scenario we're simulating, investors need to trust that the team can actually deliver, maintain, and scale the product. If you can't explain your own technical decisions, why would an investor trust you with their money?

Signs that hurt judge trust:
- Hesitation or inability to explain core components
- Contradictory explanations from different team members
- Clearly reading AI-generated documentation without understanding it
- Unable to discuss tradeoffs or alternative approaches
- Panicking when asked to show specific parts of the code

### Appropriate AI Use

AI can be a powerful tool when used correctly:

**Good Uses:**
- Quick syntax lookups and API documentation
- Debugging assistance when you're stuck
- Code review and suggestions for improvements - assume it can also make mistakes
- Generating test cases - take with a grain of salt
- Architectural Discussions, trade off of design patterns

**Problematic Uses:**
- Generating entire features without understanding the implementation
- Copy-pasting large code blocks without reviewing them
- Using AI to answer questions you should already know about your project
- Relying on AI for architecture decisions without understanding the reasoning
- Having AI write your presentation or documentation
- Relying on Agentic Programming to do your work

### Best Practices

1. **Understand Before Implementing**: If AI generates code, read through it, understand what it does, and refactor if needed
2. **Own Your Decisions**: Be able to articulate why you chose AI-generated solutions over alternatives
3. **Team Knowledge Sharing**: Make sure all team members understand the major components, not just the person who wrote them
4. **Document Your Reasoning**: Keep notes on architectural decisions and why you made them
5. **Test and Verify**: Don't assume AI-generated code works correctly or efficiently

Remember: The goal is to learn and demonstrate your capabilities. AI should augment your skills, not replace your understanding.

## Ownership

- The repository and project are **100% your team's property**
- The Alumni Society will not ask for financial compensation or credit
- The Alumni Society cannot intervene in ownership disputes between team members
- The Alumni Society is not responsible for any legal issues arising from projects
- We provide a platform for innovation and collaboration only

## Hardware

- Participants may bring any hardware they own and need for their projects
- **No AWS or AI credits** will be provided this year
- **SDRs available**: If you're working on a Digital Signal Processing project and need an SDR (Software Defined Radio), we will supply one
